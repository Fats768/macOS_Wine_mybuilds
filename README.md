# Winehq style macOS Builds

Currently Winehq is not providing macOS builds until they replace the now deprecated builder, as a temporary measure I'll attach `wine-stable`, `wine-devel` & `wine-staging` builds here that includes most dependencies, meaning XQuartz-2.7.7 or later is not required unless you desire to use X11 over macDriver.

#### _Please Note;_
These will function like macOS pkg releases but are packaged within a `.tar.xz`.\
I won't be making pkg installer, these packages include `wine` and `wine64`

### How to install using brew;
First add my tap
```
brew tap gcenx/wine
```
##### The tap provides;
- `gcenx-wine-stable`
- `gcenx-wine-devel`
- `gcenx-wine-staging`

##### Next select the desired wine package to be installed, for an example I'll select `gcenx-wine-stable`
```
brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx-wine-stable
```
This will install `Wine Stable` into `/Applications` and function as the official brew cask would (but _doesn't_ require XQuartz)

#### How manually to install;
Download the desired package from [releases](https://github.com/Gcenx/macOS_Wine_builds/releases) unpack, now move the `Wine *` bundle to `/Applications` and use as you would a Winehq release.

## gecko & mono are included;
`wine-gecko` & `wine-mono` are included within these custom `Wine-*` packages, usually wine(64/32on64) will download and then install .msi packages into each and every wineprefix increasing prefix size instead the "shared" packages are used to reduce prefix size.

## Don't open wine issues here!;
Wine bugs/regressions need to be reported via [Winehq Bugzilla](https://bugs.winehq.org/)\
Packaging related issues should be opened here.\
As Iâ€™m not too familiar with brew so any issues with the provided casks/formulas should be reported.
